# github-practice-assignment

This is a change on the testing branch.

My goals with this class is to learn good coding habits that I can utilize in my own research.
Additionally, I want to learn how to better organize code for use in teams and for reproducibility.

Reproducibility is very important because it helps us to be able to grow off of and learn from 
old experiments. This is because we can easily re-create old findings, analyze old experiments with
ease, and improve off of past made mistakes.
