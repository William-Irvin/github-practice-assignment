```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

I expect to include the following outside of my code chunks:
1) Explanations for Code and Operations
2) Explanations of the Product (ex. Figure) produced by a code chunk
3) Statments of Methodology (such as Stat Test Used) to aid in Reproducibility
```{r setup, Multiplication}
    blackjack = 7 * 3
    print(blackjack)
```
